# ecg_filters
An implementation of IIR filters for ECG signal processing, including Butterworth HP/LP/BP + Notch filters.

## Deliverables
- C/C++ library for ECG filtering, either on low-resource microcontrollers or desktop systems.
- Should be highly optimized.
- Multiple filter types: Butterworth High-Pass, Low-Pass, Band-Pass, and Notch filters.
- Configurable filter parameters: cutoff frequencies, filter order, sampling rate.
- Should be feasible in ESP/STM32, and ESP8266 microcontrollers.
